# Privacy Policy for SnoozeTab

**Effective Date:** [July 06, 2025]

Thank you for using **SnoozeTab** â€” a Chrome extension that helps you snooze, sort, and manage your browser tabs for better focus and memory performance.

## ðŸ”’ Data Collection

SnoozeTab **does not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data.

The extension works entirely within your browser and uses local browser APIs to manage tabs. Specifically:

- Tab information (like title and URL) is only accessed **locally** to display it in the extension popup.
- Snooze settings are stored using **Chrome's local storage**, which is confined to your device.
- No data is sent to any external servers or third parties.

## ðŸ“¦ Permissions Explanation

We use the following Chrome permissions solely for core features:

- `tabs`: To list and manage your open tabs.
- `storage`: To save your snoozed tab settings locally.
- `alarms`: To schedule when snoozed tabs should be restored.
- `host permissions (<all_urls>)`: To access the metadata of tabs for display only. We do **not** inject scripts or collect any content from web pages.

## âœ… Your Privacy, Your Control

- **No analytics**
- **No tracking**
- **No third-party access**

Everything stays on your machine.
